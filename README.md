Kitsu's Destiny is a roguelite incremental RPG made in RPG Maker. It has a dynasty mechanic in which the more damage you deal to the Dark Lady, the more Gold and Experience your daughter gets to try and beat her again once you lose. You have weapons, armour and stat boosts to purchase, and the longer you take to beat her, the more powerful insignias you get which allow you extra attacks. It may be a grinding simulator, but you can win, it's all about how quick you can do it.
